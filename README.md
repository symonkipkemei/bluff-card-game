## The bluff card game
If you are not cheating,you are not trying hard enough.


## Brief:
Bluff is a card game where the players aim to get rid of all of their cards.
It is a game of deception, with cards being played face-down and players being permitted to 
lie about the cards they have played. A challenge is usually made by players calling out 
the name of the game, and the loser of a challenge has to pick up every card played so far.
